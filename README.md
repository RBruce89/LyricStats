# Introduction

LyricStats is a quick way to break down the complexity of song lyrics, but it works just the same to break down the complexity of speeches, short stories, or any other text.

## Features

#### Enter the text youâ€™d like to analyze, and LyricStats will tell you;
* The total number of words
* The total number of unique words
* The percentage of unique words
* The total letters
* The average length of unique words
* The average length of all the words
* Every word used

#### You can also export the stats from multiple inquiries to a text file to easily compare them
